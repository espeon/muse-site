description: Learn how to install Muse Audio with Docker Compose.
---

# Requirements
Muse consists of multiple separate programs (pseudo-microservices)

### Maki - the main server

- Rust-based. It should run fine with precompiled binaries.
- If you're building from source, you'll need [Rust](https://rustup.rs) installed.

### Nozomi - the client

- Next.js based. 
- If you are building from source, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.


# Installation
As mentioned before, the only supported option is via Docker Compose.

### Install Docker
- Follow the guide [on the Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install on Linux.
- If you are on Windows or MacOS, you may want to [install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

### Use the Compose file

Create a compose.yml file with the following content or add the services to your existing file.

```yaml title="compose.yml"
services:
  maki-db:
    image: postgres
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password

  maki:
    image: ghcr.io/espeon/muse/maki:latest
    volumes:
      - "/path/to/music:/music"
      # art cache folder
      - "./maki/art:/art"
    ports:
      - "3033:3033"
    env_file:
      - ".env"
    depends_on:
      - "maki-db"

  nozomi:
    image: ghcr.io/espeon/muse/nozomi:latest
    ports:
      - "3031:3031"
    env_file:
      - ".env"
    depends_on:
      - "maki"

  umi:
    image: ghcr.io/espeon/umi/umi:latest
    volumes:
      # mount for lyrics cache
      - ./tmp/db:/usr/src/app/db
    ports:
      - "3032:3032"
    env_file:
      - ".env"

networks:
  default:
    name: muse
```

### Set up the environment

You will also need a .env file with the following contents copied and filled out:

```sh title=".env"
# Please, no slashes at the end for any URLs.

# Internal Maki base URL (e.g. the one that a container can reach)
INTERNAL_MAKI_BASE_URL=http://maki:3033
# External Maki base URL (the one the user can reach)
EXTERNAL_MAKI_BASE_URL=http://api.muse.lutea.co
# The base URL for Nozomi *the user can reach*
NOZOMI_BASE_URL=http://muse.lutea.co
# The base URL for Umi *the user can reach*
# Can either be a subdomain or a path, if you have that set up
UMI_BASE_URL=http://umi.muse.lutea.co

# The default oauth client is ZITADEL.
ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID=y0ur-cl13nt-1d
ZITADEL_CLIENT_SECRET=y0ur-cl13nt-s3cr3t
ZITADEL_ISSUER=https://zitadel.your.domain
AUTH_SECRET=y0ur-auth-s3cr3t

DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@maki-db:5432/postgres

# Your music mount point
MOUNT=/music

# Last.FM API creds
FM_KEY=your-fm-api-key
FM_SECRET=your-fm-secret

# Spotify API creds
SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-api-creds
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-secret

# Apple Music API creds, for Umi
APPLE_MUSIC_USER_TOKEN=yourAppleMusicUserToken

# Change these if you don't need them
RUST_BACKTRACE=1
RUST_LOG=info
```

## Routing
You should seriously consider running muse behind a reverse proxy. They have plenty of advantages, such as setting up SSL, and custom routing.

### Traefik
Traefik is a config based proxy. 

To use Traefik with Muse, you'll need to add it to the docker-compose (or have all the exposed services in the same network) and set up labels on the services you want to expose.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  reverse-proxy:
    # The official v2 Traefik docker image
    image: traefik:latest
    # Enables the web UI and tells Traefik to listen to docker
    command:
      - "--log.level=DEBUG"
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker"
      - "--entrypoints.https.address=:443"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.https.acme.tlschallenge=true"
      #- "--certificatesresolvers.https.acme.caserver=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.https.acme.email=your@email.co"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.https.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
    ports:
      # The HTTP port
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      # The Web UI (enabled by --api.insecure=true)
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      # So that Traefik can listen to the Docker events
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - "./letsencrypt:/letsencrypt"
    networks:
        # traefik_proxy is only needed if you are splitting your services up
      - traefik_proxy
      - default
```

On each service you want to expose, add this (for this example, we'll use nozomi):

```yml
services:
  nozomi:
    image: ghcr.io/espeon/muse/nozomi:latest
    ports:
      - "3031:3031"
    env_file:
      - ".env"
    depends_on:
      - "maki"
    # Add these labels
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.nozomi.rule=Host(`muse.your.domain`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nozomi.tls.certresolver=dns"
      - "traefik.docker.network=traefik_proxy"
    networks:
      - traefik_proxy
      - default

# Add these networks if your traefik instance is in a separate file
networks:
  traefik_proxy:
    external: true
    name: traefik_proxy
  default:
    driver: bridge
```
